# House_price_prediction_using-KFold-and-Navie_Bayes-classifier

This is a minor Project of MCA (Mater of Computer Applicatation),  which mainly focus on predicting the prices of real-Estate house prices using Navie_bayes Classification with the help of KFold Cross validatation techinique. Kfold validatation is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. Here we are splitting the dataset into 11 folds and validating it using navie_bayes classifier. 


Algorithm:
1. Read the training dataset.
2. Determine a class label for the   predication in the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data.
4. Split the dataset in to training and testing data.
5. Apply K-Fold-Cross Validation Technique.
6. Apply Naive Bayesian classification algorithm.
7. Predict the model accuracy. 
8. Consider the new testing dataset and predict the price of the real-estate.
