# House_price_predictataion_using-KFold-and-Navie_Bayes-classifier

This Project mainly focus on predicting the prices of real-Estate house prices using Navie_bayes Classification with the help of KFold Cross validatation techinique.
Kfold validatation is used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning algorithm. Here we are splitting the dataset into 11 folds and validating it using navie_bayes classifier.
